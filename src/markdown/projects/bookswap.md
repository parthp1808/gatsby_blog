description: "A website that allows users to create wishlists, make an inventory for the books they own and trade books with other users. Built with react.js, javascript, html, css, bootstrap. Uses a django/python back end. Work in progress. The concept is inspired by minimalism, and made to give old books new life. The last page of a book doesn't have to be the end."
