description: "I use to work in the Toys and Candy industry....clearly I didn't want to grow up. I'm a web developer with an education in Economics, product development and supply chain. Change will always be a constant in any industry but I am always trying to stay ahead by learning new skills, and learning to adapt to any situation. "
